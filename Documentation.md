# Preamble
The Luna L2 is a simple, lightweight, RISC CPU that aims to be clean while also leveraging some luxuries from CISC, with the ultimate end goal of being easy to teach and learn.<br><br>

# Registers
L2 has 34 total registers for the storage and manipulation of data and information:<br><br>
R0-R12: general purpose registers, all can be written to and read from<br>
E0-E12: extra registers, also general purpose. The standard calling convention uses registers E0-E6<br>
E13-E14: Assembler reserved for PIE mode and PIE macros, do not use<br>
SP: stack pointer<br>
PC: program counter/instruction pointer<br>
IRV: interrupt return address storage<br>
IR: interrupt register<br>
B: bank register<br>
FP: frame pointer; not related to SP in any way<br>

# Instructions
The Luna L2 has 32 unique instructions that allow the CPU to interact with registers, memory, and the BIOS<br><br>

1. MOV: moves a value from the source to the destination; source can be register or immediate or a displacement target (only addition and subtraction).<br>
2. HLT: stops the CPU from executing instructions.<br>
3. JMP: sets the program counter to the specified address; address can be register or immediate.<br>
4. INT: calls a BIOS interrupt. [Jump to interrupts](#interrupts)<br> 
5. JNZ: sets the program counter to the specified address if the register is not zero; address can be immediate or register.<br>
6. NOP: no-op; does nothing.<br>
7. CMP: sets the specified register to 1 if the other two registers are the same; otherwise sets to 0.<br>
8. JZ: sets the program counter to the specified address if the register is zero.<br>
9. INC: increments a register by 1.<br>
10. DEC: decrements a register by 1.<br>
11. PUSH: Pushes a word to the stack and increments the stack pointer by 2; word can be in a register or an immediate.<br>

# Memory Map
The standard Luna L2 memory map is as follows:<br>
## 16-bit mode
0x0000 - 0xEFFF: GP RAM<br>
0xF000 - 0xF009: Audio controller registers<br>
0xFA0A - 0xFA11: Mouse registers<br>
0xFA12: Keyboard register<br>
0xFA13 - 0xFA1A: PIT registers<br>
0xFA1B - 0xFA30: Network controller registers<br>
0xFA31 - 0xFA36: RTC registers<br>
0xFA37 - 0xFC36: IDT
0xFE00 - 0xFFFF (switch to higher/lower in banks of 512 bytes using B register; addresses that exceed VRAM will write/read from the final byte in VRAM): VRAM<br><br>

## Device registers
### VRAM
VRAM controls the screen graphics; 1 byte in VRAM is equivalent to 1 pixel on screen with the RGB332 color scheme; this makes for a 320x200 resolution with 8 bits per pixel for 64,000 bytes of VRAM.<br>
The display refreshes at 70 hertz.<br>
### Audio controller
Byte 0: Play flag; commands the audio controller to play sound based on given parameters.<br>
Bytes 1-4: 32-bit pointer of audio start (reads from mapper so MMIO works); tells the audio controller where to start from.<br>
Bytes 5-8: 32-bit size of audio; gets added to the start pointer to determine where to stop playing audio.<br>
Byte 9: done flag; set to 1 when the audio controller is done playing audio.<br>
### Mouse registers
Bytes 0-3: 32-bit X position of mouse.<br>
Bytes 4-7: 32-bit Y position of mouse.<br>
### Keyboard register
Byte 0: character code of last key pressed.<br>
### PIT registers
Bytes 0-3: 32-bit programmed countdown value (PIT updates every millisecond)
Bytes 4-7: 32-bit actual countdown value (when this reaches 0, the PIT interrupt will be triggered and it will be reset to the programmed countdown value)<br>
### RTC registers
Byte 0: Current second<br>
Byte 1: Current minute<br>
Byte 2: Current hour<br>
Byte 3: Current day<br>
Byte 4: Current month<br>
Byte 5: Current year minus 2000<br>
### Power controller register
Byte 0: current battery level; 100% if no battery<br><br>

# Assembly
The Luna toolchain has a custom assembler (`las`) to convert programs from assembly language to object format that can then be linked and then run on L2. (Flags can be found in the [frontend](#frontend) section.)<br>
## Syntax specifications
The syntax of L2 assembly is similar to that of Intel assembly syntax. An instruction consists of a mnemonic, then the operands. Above, there were no specifications on which instructions use which registers, since every instruction that uses registers can use any register.<br>
Except for LOD/LODE, STR/STRE, LODF/LODFE, and STRF/STRFE, the destination register is always the first register in the instruction.<br>
You can use a label name followed by a colon to make a label, which gets turned into a numerical offset at assembly time. Therefore you can treat them as numbers as well. These can also be used as functions with `call` and `ret`.<br>
## Custom directives
There are some directives in LAS that do not correspond to any instruction on L2. They are as follows:<br>
`call <label>`: calculates the return address, pushes it onto the stack, and jumps to the label specified<br>
`ret`: jumps to the value in register `e11`<br>
`pusha`: Pushes all GP registers from R0 upwards.<br>
`popa`: Pops all GP registers from E12 downwards.<br>
`lod_ptr`: Emits LOD16/LOD32 based on current assembler mode.<br>
`str_ptr`: Emits STR16/STR32 based on current assembler mode.<br>
`.ascii <string>`: defines a sequence of ASCII bytes, wrapped in quotation marks<br>
`.asciz <string>`: defines a sequence of ASCII bytes, wrapped in quotation marks (null terminated)<br>
`.word <number>`: defines a 2-byte constant<br>
`.dword <number>`: defines a 4-byte constant<br>
`.ptr <number or label>`: defines a number with the width of the current mode; memory locations can be used with this.<br>
`.global <label>`: exposes a symbol to other object files.<br>
`.bits <16/32>` changes the mode of the assembler to the specified mode (does not change CPU; use `SET`)<br>
`.embed <file>`: includes a file in the object code the assembler at that location.<br>
`.org <location>`: tells the linker to calculate all offsets with respect to the origin.<br>
`.fill <number>`: Tells the linker to fill the resulting binary until it reaches the size specified.<br>
`.pad <number>`: inserts the specified number of null bytes at that location.<br>
`.byte <bytes, seperated by a comma>`: inserts the specified bytes at that location until a newline.<br><br>
## Examples
For assembly examples, I recommend you see the many assembly files in `programs/luna-os/` as they are much better than the examples below.<br><br>
`mov r1, 5` (destination: r1, source: 5)<br>
`mov r2, fp + 5` (destination: r2, source: fp + 5)<br>
`pop r1` (destination: r1)<br>
`add r3, r1, r2` (destination: r3, source 1: r1, source 2: r2)<br>
`mylabel:
    mov r1, 1
    ret`<br>
`call mylabel`<br>
`.ascii "Hello world!"`<br>
`.global mysymbol` (exposes 'mysymbol' to other object code)<br>

# Linking
The Luna toolchain has a custom linker (`l2ld`) that will convert files from object format to executable format. Flags for L2LD can be found below<br><br>

# C compilation
The Luna toolchain has a custom C compiler (`lcc1`) that will compile from C (C99) to assembly. Flags for LCC1 can be found below.<br>
Please note that LCC1 is incomplete in terms of C features supported but an effort is being made to add new features, however most features used in C99 are supported at least to some degree.<br>
## Variable Attributes
In LCC1, you can use `__attribute__((<attribute(s)>))` to specify attributes for variables in the manner below:<br>
`int foo __attribute__((require_const)) = 5;`<br>
`int foo() __attribute__((noreturn)) { ... }`<br>
All valid attributes are listed below:<br>
`noreturn`: tells compiler to not pop a return address from the stack at the beginning of a function or adding a `ret` at the end of a function. (valid for functions)<br>
`require_const`: tells compiler to require that the non-global variable in question have a constant compile time initializer. (valid for variables)<br><br>
## Extensions
In LCC1, there are a few extensions to make programming L2 applications easier. They are as follows:<br>
`short short <int>`: Specifies an 8-bit integer without a custom type like `uint8_t`.<br>
`__embed__`: Embeds a file into the resulting assembly file; equivalent to `.embed` but from C. Syntax: `__embed__ <pre (puts at top of file instead at canonical location)/static (no auto .global)> <label name> (("<file path>"))`<br>
`void*` dereferences: equivalent to `char`/`short short int` dereferences; grabs 8 bits.<br>
Pointer increments: **ALL** pointer types when incremented will be incremented by 1, not by the size of the element. To increment by the size of the element, add by `sizeof(ptr)` instead.<br>
## Integer Chart
`short short`: 8 bits (1 byte)<br>
`short/<none>`: 16 bits (2 bytes)<br>
`long`: 32 bits (4 bytes)<br>
`long long`: unsupported<br><br>

# Frontend
The Luna toolchain has a simple compiler frontend (`lcc`) which is similar to that of GCC or Clang. LCC will also automatically detect each file's type and use the relevant subtool for it.<br>
## Compiling a program
To compile a program, use the following: `lcc <flags> <input file(s)> -o <output file>`<br>
## Flags
`-o`: specifies output file (L2LD)<br>
`-Werror`: upgrades all warnings to errors (LAS/LCC1)<br>
`-fpie`: Specifies to compile in position independent executable mode (LCC1/LAS/L2LD)<br>
`-fpie-16`: Specifies to L2LD to link your PIE in 16 bit mode (L2LD)<br>
`-fpie-32`: Specifies to L2LD to link your PIE in 32 bit mode (L2LD)<br>
`-c`: do not invoke linker (`l2ld`) after assembly is complete (LAS)<br>
`-v`: shows version of LCC and exits<br>
`-si`: shows command invocations LCC makes<br>
`-S`: do not invoke assembler (`las`) after compilation is complete (LCC1)<br>
`-fno-autolink`: disallows L2LD pulling from standard libraries if a symbol is undefined after initial linking (L2LD)<br>
## Supported file types
`.s/.S/.asm`: assembly<br>
`.o/.obj`: object file<br>
`.c/.h/.cpp/.hpp/.cxx/.hxx/.cc/.hh`: C (C++ is not supported; extra extensions are present for compatibility.)<br>
